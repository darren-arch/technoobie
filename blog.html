                    Not really that easy, there were a ton of hoops to jump through.
                    The first and biggest hoop was how in the world would I publish it? Well since I am doing this
                    to learn technical experience, I didn't want to just make a website from a website builder. So,
                    I had to find out how I could make a public website. Although it took me quite awhile, It is
                    pretty simple. For this website, to test the code before I update the actual website. I use a
                    code compiler such as Visual Studio to make the process of writing the code easier. Then I can 
                    open the documents and check to make sure that everything is working. After which I use github to
                    host the website. I followed a pretty simple tutorial by 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev" class="blog-link" target="_blank">
                        SuperSimpleDev.
                    </a>
                    Where he showed how you upload the documents to github then have github set up a page. From there I
                    had to buy a Domain, I chose namecheap, then attach the domain to the github website. Thats what I
                    have done so far, now I am learning the basics with html and css, so that my website won't look 
                    completely awful. After that, I plan on tracking my progress on here. Showing how I will complete my
                    Comptia A+ exams, hopefully the Security+, how I am learning python, JS, and so on. I'm also new to 
                    blogging so my blogging skills should get more descriptive as I go. 12/19/22

                    I finnally finished it. I was really scared, but it was actually pretty easy. Granted I spent like
                    4 months just on the first test, because I came from a background of not knowing anything. However,
                    I learned how to study for these exams, and it is really quite simple. I learned this from Proffessor Messer,
                    if you know every one of the terms on

                        Comptia's Exam Objectives
                    </a>
                    then you WILL PASS THE TEST. So what I did was I made a

                    </a>
                    with all of the terms from the exam objectives. I can promise you with certainty that you will pass if
                    you know those terms. The test was verbatim what was on the exam objectives. Now studying for the Core 2
                    I plan on spending most of my time reviewing the 1102 exam objectives. If I can't find a definition for a
                    term I will look through the book I got which was very inciteful.

                        Mike Meyer's 11th edition book
                    </a>
                    was extrodinarily helpful in taking every aspect of computers and putting it into simple understandable
                    terms. However, in the book he doesn't just go over what is on the A+, he goes over everything to do with
                    intro to IT. This makes the book a very thick long read. So I didn't read all the way through it. Which
                    is why I relied on the exam objectives to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. I plan on writing down fifty
                    new terms a day on my

                    are listed. 1/7/23
